# Research Gaps and Opportunities: Federated Learning with Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Overview

This document identifies specific research gaps at the intersection of Federated Learning (FL) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and proposes potential research directions.

---

## 1. Core Research Gap

### Current State

**Federated Learning Security:**
- Relies on classical cryptography (RSA, ECC, AES)
- Secure aggregation protocols use RSA/ECC for key exchange
- Homomorphic encryption uses classical schemes (Paillier, ECC-based)

**The Quantum Threat:**
- Quantum computers will break RSA and ECC
- "Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks already happening
- Timeline: 10-20 years to large-scale quantum computers

**Post-Quantum Cryptography:**
- NIST has standardized PQC algorithms (2024)
- Larger keys and ciphertexts (10-100x)
- Different performance characteristics
- Not yet integrated into FL systems

### The Gap

**No comprehensive framework for quantum-resistant federated learning that maintains:**
1. Security against quantum adversaries
2. Communication efficiency
3. Privacy guarantees
4. Practical performance

---

## 2. Specific Research Gaps

### Gap 1: Efficient Post-Quantum Secure Aggregation

#### Problem
- Current secure aggregation (Bonawitz et al., 2017) uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- DH is broken by quantum computers (Shor's algorithm)
- Direct replacement with PQC increases communication 50-100x

#### Why It's Hard
```
Classical Secure Aggregation:
- ECC public key: 32 bytes
- Ciphertext: 48 bytes
- 1000 clients: ~80 KB total

PQC Secure Aggregation (naive):
- Kyber public key: 1,184 bytes
- Ciphertext: 1,088 bytes  
- 1000 clients: ~2.2 MB total (27x increase)
```

#### Research Opportunities

**A. Compressed PQC Keys for FL**
- Exploit structure in FL (repeated communication)
- Key caching and reuse strategies
- Aggregate key generation

**B. Hybrid Protocols**
- Combine symmetric crypto + PQC for key establishment
- Use PQC only when necessary (e.g., initial handshake)

**C. Lattice-Based Threshold Cryptography**
- Distributed key generation among clients
- No single point of failure
- Reduce server trust assumptions

**Potential Impact:** 
- First practical quantum-resistant secure aggregation
- Enable privacy-preserving FL in post-quantum era
- High publication potential (top-tier venues)

---

### Gap 2: Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption for FL

#### Problem
Current FL with homomorphic encryption:
- Uses Paillier (RSA-based) - quantum vulnerable
- Or BGV/BFV (lattice-based) - not optimized for FL

#### Challenges
- Lattice-based HE has large ciphertext expansion
- Computation on encrypted gradients is slow
- Managing encryption noise over multiple aggregation rounds

#### Research Opportunities

**A. Lightweight HE for Gradient Aggregation**
- Design HE scheme specifically for FL operations
- Only needs addition, no multiplication
- Reduce ciphertext size and computation

**B. Approximate HE for FL (CKKS-based)**
- CKKS supports floating-point operations
- Optimize for gradient precision requirements
- Trade-off noise vs. model accuracy

**C. Hybrid Encrypted Aggregation**
```
Round 1-10: Differential privacy (fast, no crypto)
Round 11-20: PQC homomorphic encryption (slow, strong privacy)
```
- Adaptive privacy based on stage of training

**Potential Contributions:**
- Novel HE scheme for FL
- Formal security proofs against quantum adversaries
- Implementation and benchmarking

---

### Gap 3: Communication-Efficient PQC for FL

#### Problem
PQC algorithms have 10-100x larger keys/signatures than classical

**Impact on FL:**
```
Communication per round:
Classical: 100 MB (model) + 1 MB (crypto) = 101 MB
PQC (naive): 100 MB (model) + 100 MB (crypto) = 200 MB
```

#### Research Opportunities

**A. PQC-Aware Gradient Compression**
- Joint optimization of gradient compression + PQC
- Sparsify before encryption
- Structured encryption (only encrypt important gradients)

**B. Stateful PQC for FL**
- Use hash-based signatures (XMSS) despite statefulness
- FL's structured rounds make state management easier
- Much smaller signatures than stateless schemes

**C. Aggregate Signatures**
- Multiple clients sign together
- One aggregate signature instead of n individual signatures
- Lattice-based aggregate signatures (emerging area)

**D. Post-Quantum Code-Based Aggregation**
- McEliece has fast encryption
- Explore code-based schemes for aggregation protocols

**Metrics to Optimize:**
- Total bytes transmitted per round
- End-to-end training time
- Model accuracy (ensure compression doesn't hurt)

---

### Gap 4: Hybrid Classical-PQC Protocols for Federated Learning

#### Motivation
- Immediate security (classical crypto)
- Future-proof security (PQC)
- Smooth migration path

#### Research Opportunities

**A. Adaptive Hybrid FL**
```
if quantum_threat_level < threshold:
    use classical_crypto()  # Fast
else:
    use PQC()  # Secure but slower
```

**B. Layered Security**
- Outer layer: PQC for key exchange
- Inner layer: Classical symmetric crypto (AES) for bulk encryption
- "Defense in depth"

**C. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) + FL**
- If quantum network available, use QKD
- Fallback to PQC if no quantum channel

**Novel Aspect:** Context-aware security adaptation

---

### Gap 5: Formal Security Analysis of PQC-FL Systems

#### Problem
- No formal security models for quantum-resistant FL
- Existing FL security proofs assume classical adversaries
- New attack vectors with PQC (e.g., side-channel attacks on lattice crypto)

#### Research Opportunities

**A. Security Model for Post-Quantum FL**
Define adversary capabilities:
- Quantum computation
- Access to aggregated updates
- Compromise of subset of clients

Prove security properties:
- Confidentiality of model updates

- Analyze information leakage via quantum side channels

**C. Attack Analysis**

**Contribution:** Theoretical foundation for secure PQC-FL

---

### Gap 6: PQC for Decentralized Federated Learning

#### Motivation
- Centralized server is single point of failure
- Decentralized FL (peer-to-peer) is more robust

#### Challenges

- Need Byzantine-robust aggregation
- Authentication without central authority

#### Research Opportunities

**Impact:** Truly decentralized, quantum-resistant FL

---

### Gap 7: Hardware Acceleration for PQC in FL

#### Problem
- PQC is computationally expensive
- Edge devices (phones, IoT) have limited resources
- Software-only PQC is too slow for real-time FL

#### Research Opportunities

**A. FPGA/ASIC Acceleration**
- Design hardware accelerators for Kyber, Dilithium
- Optimize for FL workloads (batch operations)

**B. GPU Optimization**
- Parallelize lattice operations
- Batch encrypt multiple gradients

**C. Neural Processing Units (NPUs) for Crypto**

- Lattice crypto also uses matrix operations
- Co-design FL training and PQC on NPUs

**Interdisciplinary:** Computer architecture + cryptography + ML

---

### Gap 8: Benchmarking and Standardization

- Difficult to compare research approaches
- No reference implementations

#### Research Opportunities

**A. PQC-FL Benchmark Suite**
Create standardized benchmarks:

fl_model = pqcfl.FederatedModel(
    model=my_neural_network,
    crypto=pqcfl.Kyber768,
    privacy=pqcfl.DifferentialPrivacy(epsilon=1.0)
)

# Train with automatic PQC
fl_model.train(clients, rounds=100)
```

**C. Standardization Proposal**
- Propose standards to IETF, IEEE
